# Toolbox
Some tools I wrote for convenience. 

1. Some Metrics for machine learning: NRMSE, Accuracy, F1-score, k-fold cross validation.<br>
2. K-nearest neighbor imputation (knnimpute). Impute missing values of numeric dataset. <br>
3. Find the top x% values in a distribution. Given a data set and a percentage, this returns the threshold above witch is selected to be the top x% of this distribution. <br>  :)
